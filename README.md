My implementation of various types of algorithms.

## Dynamic Programming

-   **Longest increasing subsequence problem**, O(n^2) time complexity and O(n) space complexity (better is possible)
-   **Subset sum problem**, O(n^2) time and O(n) space complexity (better is possible)

## Mathematics

-   **Primality testing**, O(sqrt(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, deterministic approach for large n
-   **Permutations**, O(n!) time and space complexity.

## Searching

-   **bisection search**, worst case on ordered arrays is O(log(n)) time and O(1) space complexity
-   **depth-first search**, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
-   **breadth-first search**, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity

## Sorting

-   **bubble sort**, worst case O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
-   **heap sort**, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
-   **merge sort**, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
-   **quick sort**, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

## TODO

-   O(nlog(n)) solution for longest increasing subsequence problem
-   O(n) solution for subset sum problem
-   nth-Fibonacci in O(log(n)) time complexity
