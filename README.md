My implementation of various types of algorithms.
## Dynamic Programming
* Longest increasing subsequence problem, O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
## Searching
* bisection search, worst case on ordered arrays is O(log(n)) time and O(1) space complexity
* depth-first search, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
* breadth-first search, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
## Sorting
* bubble sort, worst case O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
* heap sort, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
* merge sort, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
* quick sort, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
