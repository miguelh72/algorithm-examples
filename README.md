My implementation of various types of algorithms.
## Dynamic Programming
* __Longest increasing subsequence problem__, O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
## Searching
* __bisection search__, worst case on ordered arrays is O(log(n)) time and O(1) space complexity
* __depth-first search__, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
* __breadth-first search__, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
## Sorting
* __bubble sort__, worst case O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
* __heap sort__, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
* __merge sort__, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
* __quick sort__, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
