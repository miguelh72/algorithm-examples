My implementation of various types of algorithms.
## Dynamic Programming
* __Longest increasing subsequence problem__, O(n^2) time complexity and O(n) space complexity (better is possible)
* __Subset sum problem__, O(n^2) time and O(n) space complexity (better is possible)
## Mathematics
* __Primality testing__, O(sqrt(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, deterministic approach for large n
 ## Searching
* __bisection search__, worst case on ordered arrays is O(log(n)) time and O(1) space complexity
* __depth-first search__, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
* __breadth-first search__, worst case O(n + e) where e is the number of edges in tree and O(n) space complexity
## Sorting
* __bubble sort__, worst case O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
* __heap sort__, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
* __merge sort__, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
* __quick sort__, worst case O(nlog(n)) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
## TODO
* O(nlog(n)) solution for longest increasing subsequence problem
* O(n) solution for subset sum problem
